Summary of Results / Observations / Insights:
We observed that the efficient version of the solution requires less memory than the basic version, yet it takes longer to run. 
We learned that the efficient version runs in O(mn) time while using only O(m + n) space, whereas the basic version has a runtime and space requirement of O(mn).
So the efficient version brings down the space requirement while increasing the running time by at most a constant factor. 
During the course of this project and within our plots, we observed this to be true. The longer the strings we tested, the more apparent this became.
Contributions:
Peter and Luke both contributed to the project and shared the responsibilities related to coding, testing, and report preparation. 
Luke performed the coding and testing for reading in the input.txt file and for implementing the basic version of the solution.
Peter performed the coding and testing for the string generation and implementing the memory efficient version of the solution.
Both of us worked together on the code for determining the memory requirements for each solution, creating the plots, and preparing the summary/report.
